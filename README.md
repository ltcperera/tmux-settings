## Terminal Multiplexer Setup

This is my tmux setup with customizations that I use for development at the terminal. Steps to get this setup are as follows:

1. Change to the $HOME/.config directory and clone the tmux-settings.git repository as follows

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:ltcperera/tmux-settings.git tmux
   ```

2. Checkout the tmux tpm plugin as follows:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm plugins/tpm
   ```

3. Logout and back in and start tmux.

4. Hit the ` + I key to install the plugins.
